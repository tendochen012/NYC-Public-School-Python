There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\ndisplay(schools.head())\n\n# Start coding here...\n#Get the 80% math mark, full score of SAT is 800\nm_mark = 0.8*800\n#get best_math_schools\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>=m_mark][[\"school_name\",\"average_math\"]].sort_values(by = \"average_math\",ascending= False)\n\n#view dataframe\ndisplay(best_math_schools)\n\n#add \"total_SAT\" column in schools DF\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n#ascending the schools DF based on \"total_SAT\" column\nschools = schools.sort_values(by = \"total_SAT\", ascending = False)\n\n#get the top 10 based on \"total_SAT\"\ntop_10_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].head(10)\ndisplay(top_10_schools)\n\n\n#group by caluse to analyze count, mean, and standard deviation\nlargest_std_dev = schools.groupby(by = \"borough\").agg(\n        num_schools = (\"school_name\", \"count\"),\n        average_SAT = (\"total_SAT\", \"mean\"),\n        std_SAT = (\"total_SAT\", \"std\")\n).round(2)\n\n\n#get the max standard deviation\nmax_std = largest_std_dev[\"std_SAT\"].max()\n\n#retrieve desired dataframe\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev[largest_std_dev[\"std_SAT\"] == max_std]","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":102,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\ndisplay(schools.head())\n\n# Start coding here...\n#Get the 80% math mark, full score of SAT is 800\nm_mark = 0.8*800\n#get best_math_schools\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>=m_mark][[\"school_name\",\"average_math\"]].sort_values(by = \"average_math\",ascending= False)\n\n#view dataframe\ndisplay(best_math_schools)\n\n#add \"total_SAT\" column in schools DF\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n#ascending the schools DF based on \"total_SAT\" column\nschools = schools.sort_values(by = \"total_SAT\", ascending = False)\n\n#get the top 10 based on \"total_SAT\"\ntop_10_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].head(10)\ndisplay(top_10_schools)\n\nlargest_std_dev = schools.groupby(by = \"borough\").agg(\n        num_schools = (\"school_name\", \"count\"),\n        average_SAT = (\"total_SAT\", \"mean\"),\n        std_SAT = (\"total_SAT\", \"std\")\n).round(2)\n\nmax_std = largest_std_dev[\"std_SAT\"].max()\n\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev[largest_std_dev[\"std_SAT\"] == max_std]","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1703110417733,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":198,"type":"dataFrame"},"1":{"height":323,"type":"dataFrame"},"2":{"height":323,"type":"dataFrame"},"3":{"height":198,"type":"dataFrame"},"4":{"height":198,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":45,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"building_code","type":"string"},{"name":"average_math","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_reading","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_writing","type":"integer"},{"name":"percent_tested","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"school_name":["New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School","Essex Street Academy","Lower Manhattan Arts Academy","High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies","Henry Street School for International Studies"],"borough":["Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan"],"building_code":["M022","M445","M445","M445","M056"],"average_math":[657,395,418,613,410],"average_reading":[601,411,428,453,406],"average_writing":[601,387,415,463,381],"percent_tested":[null,78.9,65.1,95.9,59.7]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
